      National Institutes of Health · Apr 2024 – Mar 2028
    </p>
    <p>
      This qualitative sub-study within the AI2Equity initiative examines how patients and healthcare providers perceive cardiovascular risk, access to care, and the role of AI-enabled tools in promoting equitable prevention and treatment. Using a three-round modified Delphi design, the study convenes approximately 170 participants across 17 focus groups to elicit consensus and divergence across stakeholder perspectives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Findings directly inform the design and evaluation of equitable AI-based cardiovascular risk tools by integrating multi-stakeholder perspectives into model development and implementation.
